## Example Outputs

**Keyword Map**  
| Requirement | Resume Evidence | Suggested Rewrite |
|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Teamwork | Group project in college | “Collaborated with 4 peers to deliver a research project, earning top 5% grade” |
| Excel | Coursework & internship | “Analyzed 5,000+ records in Excel, creating pivot tables for weekly reporting” |

**Cover Letter Template**  
- **Hook**: “I’m excited by the mission of {Company}, especially your focus on {topic}.”  
- **Fit**: “My background in {skill/experience} has prepared me to {deliver value}.”  
- **Call to Action**: “I would welcome the chance to discuss how I can contribute to {team/project}.”  

**Application Strategy**
